This was a project I wanted to do during Covid-19 lockdown period. I used python with libraries like Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV. The basic aim of the project is to detect the presence of a face mask on human faces on images. I have used deep learning to develop the face detector model.

The accuracy came out to be around 98%.
